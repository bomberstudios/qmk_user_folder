# My QMK User Folder

This is my user folder for [QMK](https://qmk.fm). It contains common settings for all my keyboards.

Feel free to look around, but do not be surprised if most of the code is horrible, useless, or both. Proceed at your own risk.


## Changelog

### 2020-11-10

- The combos I'm using for () and [] interfere with Cmd+Shift and Cmd+Alt shortcuts, so I've moved them around a bit. Now they work like this:
  - `F+R` → `(` (or `T+P` in Colemak)
  - `J+U` → `)` (or `N+L` in Colemak)
  - `D+E` → `[` (or `S+F` in Colemak)
  - `K+I` → `]` (or `E+U` in Colemak)

Now I _really_ need to get lighter springs for my switches :P


### 2020-11-09

- Removed HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS
- Removed RETRO_TAPPING
- Added combos for parens and brackets, so I can type them without leaving the home row.
