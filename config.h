// how low can we go with this? I'm seeing issues lately with this and feels like I can go lower... Let's try 100 (down from the original 150) -> However, looks like I'm not seeing those on Colemak, so maybe it's actually a problem of it being too fast?
// 2020-11-23: looks like 100 is actually worse, so I'm going to see if I can tweak the tapping term for Tab. Meanwhile, let me try with 200
// 2020-12-19: let's try 100 again, now that I've enabled HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS
// 2020-12-19: 100 is unusable with HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS, let's try 300
// 2021-02-13: let's reduce this a bit more, because I'm having issues when typing numbers and symbols where the mod won't register (although I'm now typing this note and can't see this happening, so I wonder if that's something to do with specific keyboards and only happens with the Atreus...)
// 2021-04-20: I'm having issues with Shift recently, I assume that maybe related with speed increases. So I'll set this to 150 and see what happens (or maybe I should reduce it just for the homerow shift keys?)
